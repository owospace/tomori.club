  <h2>About tomori.club</h2>

  EDIT 1: I no longer own this domain, so it will not be linked.<br>

  EDIT 2: This project was originally in raw html/css, it has been ported to Vue. If you'd like the original files, send me a message.<br>

  tomori.club *was* a domain for me and a few friends<br>
  to experiment with a talent group. The theme was based<br>
  around a character we all liked and wanted to show<br>
  appreciation towards- Nao Tomori from the 'Charlotte' anime. (๑′ᴗ‵๑)<br>
